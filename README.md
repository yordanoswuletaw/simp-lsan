# simp-lsan

[simplsan](https://github.com/yordanoswuletaw/simp-lsan) is an Amharic language gender-specific adjectives classifier machine learning model.

simplsan contains its own small [datasets](https://github.com/yordanoswuletaw/simp-lsan/blob/main/datasets.csv) (1k+) and a [word embedding algorithm](https://github.com/yordanoswuletaw/simp-lsan/blob/main/smp-lsan-v3.ipynb) tailored for the Amharic language to encode Amharic words into dense numerical vectors, capturing semantic relationships between words.
